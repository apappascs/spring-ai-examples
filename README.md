# Spring AI Examples

This repository contains a collection of examples demonstrating various use cases and integrations of the Spring AI framework.

## Examples

*   [**spring-ai-tavily**](spring-ai-tavily/README.md): This project demonstrates the integration of Spring AI with the Tavily Search API to build a conversational AI application using the Vaadin framework for the user interface.
*   [**spring-ai-mcp-client**](model-context-protocol/spring-ai-mcp-client/README.md): Shows a Spring AI client that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to interact with a remote AI model (Brave Search in this example).
*   [**spring-ai-rag-llamaparse-pgvector**](spring-ai-rag-llamaparse-pgvector/README.md): Demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using Spring AI, LlamaParse for intelligent document parsing, and PGvector as the vector store for efficient similarity search.
